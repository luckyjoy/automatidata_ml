Build a Machine Learning Model for Automatidata

### **Build a Machine Learning Model**

#### **Objective:**
Use tree-based modeling techniques to predict whether a customer is a generous tipper, with the goal of identifying factors that can help taxi cab drivers generate more revenue.

#### **Activity Breakdown:**

**Part 1: Ethical Considerations**
- Reflect on the ethical implications of predicting tipping behavior.
- Consider if the modelâ€™s objective needs adjustment to ensure fairness and avoid bias.

**Part 2: Feature Engineering**
- Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling.

**Part 3: Modeling**
- Build tree-based models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict if a customer will leave a generous tip.
- Evaluate model performance and suggest next steps for improving it.

#### **Final Deliverable:**
- Complete the activity and answer the questions in the PACE Strategy Document. Summarize your findings in an Executive Summary.
